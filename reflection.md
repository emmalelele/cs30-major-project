# What advice would I give myself
- I should've made a list of what type of obstacles i want to make. i spent quite a lot of time making the obstacles for the game.
- Maybe tried a different library other than p5play. p5play is fine but the instructions are not very clear.


## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Yes, and also the nice to have list as well. 

## Hardest part
- The hardest part was dealing with issues in downloading the p5play library and making my github live link work. Initially, when I played around with p5play in a separate laptop folder, it worked fine and had a "node_modules" folder with essential files. However, integrating it with my CS30 major project repo caused errors on github live and there was no "node_modules" folder. It took me a whole night to connect it to the index.html correctly and fix some typos and cloning repo problems.

- p5play functions aren't explained well. For example Group() and Sprite() are 2 build-in oops of the library, but they didn't provide the code for it so that all shapes I can make are a square, a circle and rectangle only.


## Most proud of?
- The whole project. I still remember at the very start of the semester I was struggling with p5js. I'm not an artistic person so anything have to do with drawing or creative coding (and a brand new language too), I find it pretty challenging. I am proud that at the end of semester I finally manage to make a proper game. The game may not be super fancy, but considering how hard it was for me at the beginning, I feel good about what I've achieved.

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
- I was planning to add some animation to the game with the balloon. I did exactly like how p5play do but somehow it doesn't work, and it doesn't throw any errors to the console so i cannot figure out
